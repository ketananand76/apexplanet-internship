🚀 Just Completed a Mini Web Development Project!

I recently worked on a simple yet fun project where I built a basic interactive webpage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

📌 What I did:

1. Created a basic webpage layout with HTML.

2. Styled the page using CSS — added colors, fonts, and spacing.

3. Added interactivity with JavaScript — a button that triggers an alert message.

💡 Objective: To understand the core building blocks of web development and implement a fully functional mini project.

📽️ I’ve recorded a quick demo of the project and added it to my Featured section—check it out!

🌱 Excited to keep learning and take on more advanced projects in the future. Feedback and suggestions are welcome!
